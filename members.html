                Nicole is a junior majoring in Economics/Mathematics and
                minoring in Risk Management. She is an aspiring actuary, and
                specializes in mathematical statistics and risk
                management/insurance. She is interested in intersecting the
                worlds of mathematics and risk management, because quantitative
                approaches and risks are two life factors that are inevitably
                co-existential. When she is not grinding for her actuarial
                exams, Nicole enjoys listening to music, sketching, playing the
                piano, and going on food adventures (especially to aesthetic
                caf√©s).

                Alan is a junior pursuing a progressive degree in mathematics
                with a minor in computer science. He plans to continue his
                studies in math as a PhD student after his graduation from USC.
                He is particularly interested in academic research, both in pure
                and applied mathematics. When he is not hammering out a proof or
                computing a Galois group, Alan spends his time skateboarding,
                playing video games, watching basketball, or reading (and
                practicing) philosophy.

                  Simon is a junior studying computer science. In addition to making the website you see now, he is also a TA for CSCI-104 and a member of HackSC. If he is not part of the problem in VSCode, then he is part of the solution in SAL. Simon loves to work out, and the only thing he loves more than working out is eating. He's from New York, so of course he loves Halal food from carts, although taco stands are a close second. He's also working on his rap career on the side, although don't ask him about it. He's already realized he needs to stay in school.
