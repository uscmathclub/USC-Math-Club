If he is not part of the problem in VSCode, then he is part of the solution in SAL. Simon loves to work out, and the only thing he loves more than working out is eating. He's from New York, so of course he loves Halal food from carts, although taco stands are a close second. He's also working on his rap career on the side, although don't ask him about it. He's already realized he needs to stay in school.

                management/insurance. She is interested in intersecting the
